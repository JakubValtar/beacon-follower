\subsection*{Robot behaviour}
The task of our robot is to continuously follow a beacon which can change a position while the robot is following it. If the distance between the robot and the beacon is sufficiently small, the robot will stop. While following the beacon it is avoiding obstacles. Obstacles are represented by a shape made with a black tape on the floor. The robot uses two motors (connected to wheels) for movement, infrared sensor for localization of the beacon and color sensor for detection of obstacles.   

\subsection*{Programming language}
We will use leJos language to implement the project.
